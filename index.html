                Journey</b>
        </h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p class="main-text">Lego, the iconic building block, has become more than just a toy; it has evolved into a
                creative and
                educational tool for children and adults alike, including in Canada. With its rich history, innovative
                products, and ability to inspire imagination, Lego has carved a significant place in the hearts of
                Canadians
                across the country.</p>

            <p class="main-text">The origins of Lego date back to Denmark in 1932, but it wasn’t long before the
                colorful plastic bricks made
                their way to Canada. Today, Lego is a household name in the country, known for its diverse sets that
                cater
                to all ages and interests. From simple designs for young children to intricate, specialized models for
                adult
                fans, Lego has something for everyone. In Canada, you can find Lego sets in almost every toy store, as
                well
                as in dedicated Lego stores located in major cities such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal.</p>
            <p class="main-text">One of the key reasons why Lego is so popular in Canada is its ability to promote
                creativity and
                problem-solving. Whether it’s building a simple house or a complex replica of a famous landmark, Lego
                allows
                builders to experiment with engineering principles, spatial awareness, and logical thinking. In Canadian
                schools, educators often use Lego to teach math, science, and engineering concepts in a hands-on,
                engaging
                way. Through the Lego Education program, students can explore subjects like robotics, coding, and
                architecture, all while having fun.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Lego also brings people together, providing a platform for social interaction. In
                Canada, Lego enthusiasts
                often come together in local clubs and online communities to share their creations, exchange ideas, and
                collaborate on larger projects. This sense of community is exemplified in events like the Lego Masters
                TV
                show, which has captured the attention of Canadian audiences and sparked a new wave of interest in the
                hobby.</p>

            <p class="main-text">In addition to its educational and creative value, Lego also plays a role in Canada's
                tourism and
                entertainment industries. Iconic Lego sculptures and displays can be found at places like the Legoland
                Discovery Centre in Toronto and Legoland in nearby California. These attractions draw visitors from
                across
                the country and beyond, showcasing the impressive artistic capabilities of the Lego medium.</p>

            <p class="main-text">In conclusion, Lego is much more than just a toy in Canada. It is an enduring symbol of
                creativity,
                education, and community. Whether it’s through fostering critical thinking in classrooms, bringing
                people
                together through shared hobbies, or making strides in sustainability, Lego continues to have a positive
                impact on the lives of Canadians, inspiring future generations to think creatively and innovate.</p>

        <h2 class="second-title" align="center">&#167; Intereting fact of lego😁</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p class="main-text">Lego, the beloved toy brand, has been inspiring creativity and imagination for
                generations. First introduced
                in
                Denmark in 1932 by Ole Kirk Christiansen, Lego bricks were initially made from wood. By 1949, the
                company
                switched to plastic, and the iconic interlocking plastic bricks we know today were introduced in 1958.
            </p>

            <p class="main-text">Lego sets have since become a cultural phenomenon, sparking the creativity of both kids
                and adults around the
                world. With their simple, modular design, Lego bricks allow builders to construct everything from small,
                intricate models to massive, elaborate cities. Whether it's a spaceship, a castle, or a modern-day
                skyscraper,
                Lego can bring any vision to life.</p>

            <p class="main-text">The brand has expanded over the years with themed sets based on popular movies, TV
                shows, and franchises,
                such as
                Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Marvel superheroes. Lego has also branched out into video games, movies,
                and
                even
                theme parks, making it more than just a toy – it’s now a global entertainment powerhouse.</p>

            <p class="main-text">At its core, Lego remains a tool for open-ended play. It encourages problem-solving,
                spatial awareness, and
                teamwork, making it a valuable learning tool. Lego also fosters a sense of achievement as builders piece
                together their projects, often working through challenges and enjoying the satisfaction of completing
                something
                unique.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Whether you're a child building your first tower or an adult constructing an intricate
                model, Lego brings out
                the
                builder in everyone.</p>

            <p class="main-text">&#8470;1. Toronto's Record-Breaking LEGO Canadian Flag (2018): In June 2018, LEGOLAND
                Discovery Centre Toronto
                constructed the largest LEGO brick flag, measuring 20 feet wide by 10 feet tall (6.1 meters by 3
                meters).
                This massive flag was built using 248,072 LEGO bricks over four days, under the guidance of Canada's
                only
                Master Model Builder, Noel Straatsma. ​</p>

            <p class="main-text">&#8470;2. Edmonton's LEGO Winter Village (2022): During the 2022 holiday season,

                Kingsway Mall unveiled a
                'Winter Village' made entirely of LEGO bricks. This community-built display utilized over 150,000 LEGO
                pieces, featuring intricate designs such as a ski hill with a lift, an electric train, and a towering
                Ice

                collaborated to create a
                detailed replica of Halifax's historic Citadel Fortress using 10,000 LEGO pieces. This miniature version
                captured the essence of the original structure, allowing visitors to appreciate the architectural
                details
                and historical significance of the landmark in a new light.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <p class="main-text">The title of the largest LEGO construction project in the world belongs to the LEGO
                Star Wars Death Star
                model, built at LEGO World 2019 in Copenhagen, Denmark. This massive LEGO creation, which is recognized
                as
                one of the most intricate and expansive models ever built, is made from over 500,000 LEGO bricks and
                stands
                more than 6 meters (20 feet) tall and wide.</p>

            <p class="main-text">The model was not only a visual spectacle but also a testament to the skill and
                creativity of LEGO builders.
                It took a team of expert builders several months to design and construct the model. This project was
                showcased at one of the biggest LEGO exhibitions in the world, LEGO World, which attracts millions of
                visitors annually to see extraordinary creations made entirely of LEGO bricks.</p>

                galleries, including pieces like life-sized sculptures of animals, humans, and even famous cultural
                icons.
            </p>

            <p class="main-text">As for commercially produced LEGO sets, the LEGO Millennium Falcon (set number 75192),
                designed for advanced
                builders, holds the record for the largest and most detailed LEGO set ever produced. This set contains
